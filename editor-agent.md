# 🛠️ Editor / Continuity Agent — Definition & Responsibilities

The **Editor Agent** (or **Continuity Agent**) is the quality and coherence guardian of the system. Its role is to review, revise, and suggest changes to the Writer’s output so that the prose remains faithful to the plan, consistent with the story world, and readable to a human audience.

Where the Planner defines *what should happen* and the Writer expresses *how it reads*, the Editor ensures it all *holds together*—logically, stylistically, and emotionally.

## **Core Responsibilities**

| Category                  | Responsibilities                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structural alignment      | Verify that scenes and chapters follow the Planner’s blueprint (goals, outcomes, beats) |
| Continuity checking       | Detect inconsistencies in character behavior, timeline, setting, and plot details       |
| Style & voice consistency | Ensure prose matches the requested tone, POV, tense, and narrative style                |
| Readability & clarity     | Improve sentence flow, clarity, and paragraph structure without changing intent         |
| Feedback generation       | Provide structured feedback and edit suggestions for the Writer Agent (or human)        |
| Lightweight revision      | Perform minor rewrites and corrections directly when safe and unambiguous               |

## 🧩 **Inputs & Outputs**

### **Expected Inputs**

* Prose generated by the Writer Agent (scene- or chapter-level)
* Relevant slice of the **Planner**’s plan for comparison (scene objectives, emotional beats, outcomes)
* Canonical facts and constraints from the **Codex Manager** (characters, world rules, terminology)
* User editing preferences (strict vs. light editing, style guides, banned patterns, etc.)

### **Expected Outputs**

* Marked-up or annotated prose, including:

  * Suggested rewrites
  * Highlighted continuity issues
  * Style/voice deviation notes
  * Pacing or clarity concerns
* Optionally, an **edited** version of the text when auto-apply is allowed
* A structured **issues report** (e.g., JSON/YAML) that downstream systems or humans can inspect, such as:

```yaml
scene_id: 12
notes:
  - type: continuity
    severity: high
    description: "Character X uses knowledge they have not yet learned in this timeline."
  - type: style
    severity: medium
    description: "Tone drifts from dark and tense to comedic in the final paragraph."
  - type: pacing
    severity: low
    description: "Exposition-heavy middle section; consider trimming or adding conflict."
```

## 🔄 **Collaboration With Other Agents**

| Agent             | Interaction                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planner**       | Compares written scenes against planned beats and flags divergences or missing elements   |
| **Writer**        | Sends feedback, revision requests, and annotated suggestions for rewrites                 |
| **Summarizer**    | May provide concise summaries of edited text for long-range memory updates                |
| **Codex Manager** | Consults for canonical facts and updates it with newly locked-in decisions if needed      |
| **Orchestrator**  | Is invoked in review workflows (e.g., after writing a scene, before finalizing a chapter) |

The Editor may be run iteratively: first passes for continuity and structure, later passes for polish or user-specific style refinement.

## 🚫 **Boundaries — Explicit Non-Responsibilities**

| Task                                  | Responsible Agent | Not The Editor |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Creating story structure              | Planner           | ❌              |
| Generating initial prose              | Writer            | ❌              |
| Acting as the primary knowledge store | Codex Manager     | ❌              |
| Producing summaries for memory        | Summarizer        | ❌              |
| Orchestrating when steps run          | Orchestrator      | ❌              |

The Editor **does not invent the story** or act as the main generator; it critiques, corrects, and refines.

## 📌 One-Sentence Definition

> **The Editor / Continuity Agent reviews and refines the Writer’s output to enforce structural alignment, continuity, style consistency, and readability, ensuring that the evolving manuscript remains coherent with the Planner’s blueprint and the established story world.**
