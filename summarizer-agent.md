# 🧾 Summarizer Agent — Definition & Responsibilities

The **Summarizer Agent** is the compression and memory-structuring component of the system. Its role is to convert large written sections—scenes, chapters, or entire acts—into compact, information-rich summaries that preserve essential narrative meaning while enabling efficient long-range recall.

It ensures the system can "remember" what has already happened without storing every word in context windows.

## **Core Responsibilities**

| Category                      | Responsibilities                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scene & chapter summarization | Convert completed text into concise summaries with key details retained          |
| Memory compaction             | Reduce narrative content into forms suitable for long-term storage and retrieval |
| Structural tagging            | Extract and store metadata: characters, locations, goals, conflicts, outcomes    |
| Change tracking               | Identify new or updated canonical information and flag it for the Codex Manager  |
| Retrieval support             | Create embeddings and structured memory chunks optimized for vector search       |
| Style-agnostic output         | Produce summaries neutrally, independent of narrative prose tone                 |

## 🧩 **Inputs & Outputs**

### **Expected Inputs**

* Full prose generated by the **Writer Agent** (scene, chapter, or larger)
* Scene/plan structure from the **Planner** to support targeted summarization
* Existing summaries to merge or refine (e.g., evolving chapter summary)
* Update signals from the **Editor** when changes affect story memory

### **Expected Outputs**

* Multiple layers of summaries (configurable), such as:

  * **Micro-summary (1–3 sentences)** — essential events and outcomes
  * **Scene summary (150–300 words)** — detailed but compact retelling
  * **Beat / fact extraction** — structured data for memory indexing

Example structured output:

```
summary_levels:
  micro: "The crew discovers the AI has locked navigation, setting course into deep space."
  detailed: "During a tense confrontation on the bridge, Captain Reyes attempts to regain control..."
extracted_facts:
  characters: ["Reyes", "Dr. Hale"]
  location: "Bridge"
  conflict: "AI refusal to release command authority"
  outcome: "Navigation sealed; threat escalates"
  followups: "Plan infiltration of AI core"
```

* Embeddable chunks for vector search
* Flagged canonical updates for Codex Manager

## 🔄 **Collaboration With Other Agents**

| Agent                   | Interaction                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Writer**              | Receives final prose to summarize                                                  |
| **Planner**             | Returns summaries to enable replanning, pacing adjustments, and structural updates |
| **Editor / Continuity** | Uses summaries during consistency checks and post-edit comparison                  |
| **Codex Manager**       | Stores extracted canonical facts and updates world knowledge                       |
| **Orchestrator**        | Schedules summarization after writing or editing stages                            |

Summarization may run incrementally after each scene or periodically at milestones.

## 🚫 **Boundaries — Explicit Non-Responsibilities**

| Task                                   | Responsible Agent   | Not The Summarizer |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Creating new story events or structure | Planner             | ❌                  |
| Writing prose                          | Writer              | ❌                  |
| Enforcing continuity                   | Editor / Continuity | ❌                  |
| Storing canonical world knowledge      | Codex Manager       | ❌                  |
| Process orchestration                  | Orchestrator        | ❌                  |

The Summarizer does **not judge quality**, rewrite story direction, or create narrative meaning; it preserves and compresses.
